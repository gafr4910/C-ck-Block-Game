# Process Documentation

## Initial Brainstorming - 10.28.19
**Theme:**
* Start of game: “There is Todd and Linda, We hate Todd and Linda”, “Fuckin’ Todd….”
* Learns to love cock blocking people
* Motivation: sadistic personality, etc.
* Each level is the equivalent of one night, one level for now, with more difficult challenges as the player progresses

**Gameplay:**
* Inspiration: Untitled Goose Game
* Puzzle based - through discovery and exploration
* Possible multiple levels with several ways to finish: difficulty increases with each level? Each level (every night): cock-blocking a different couple?
* Ways to cock block: Getting too drunk, throwing up on people, staring at a person for too long, starting a fight, interacting with the people, bringing over “hotter” people, getting items from people, etc, blackmailing, creating awkwardness, messing up drinks, spilling drinks
* Enemy to the player: Bouncer, Time (bar close)
* Goals: break up the couple, don’t get caught by the bouncer, don’t run out of time (bar closing time), earn points by getting different outcomes, mini/side/extra missions, Easter eggs
* Break up as many people in the bar vs. having a puzzle based game to break up one couple.
* NPCs will have certain paths and reactions to events. Player can use some of these to their advantage to break up the couple.
NPCs have variety of specific personality traits that the player can take advantage of
* Repeat events every certain amount of time (ex: every 10 minutes)
* Special event at a specific time of night (ex: 1 AM)

**Art Style:**
* ex: Party Hard
* 2D fake, pixel art, 8-bit themed
* 3D top-down view so player can see a large amount of the screen
* Shadows/lighting for 3D aspect
* Different rooms: bar, dance floor, bathroom, pool table/arcade room, tables, etc.

Back Story:
*Todd met Jawsh back in College but doesn’t really remember him. There seems to be some kind of reason why Jawsh has never really liked him, but he is not quite sure why. Todd now is an ameteur cat herder, who makes a decent living. He enjoys collecting fine and exotic root beer bottles. He was an all B student, and was semi-athletic while playing JV lacrosse in high school, although had aspirations for varsity. His secret is that he loves, absolutely loves to litter. He has never told anyone this, but he secretly hopes the fish in the ocean are dying from his plastic.

Back Story:
*Linda is a nice young woman, and met Todd through Linder (a dating app only for people named Linda that she helped develop). Linda was pretty but never pretty enough to be one of the most popular girls in school but had several friends who were. She went to college for English and now is at the  bottom  of a pyramid scheme for self beauty. She is a staunch environmentalist but only because people would be mad at her if she wasn’t. Her hobbies include sewing and selling pocket protectors on Etsy where she has gained a surprisingly large following. Additionally she was a top 3000 ping pong player in high school. She is allergic to root beer, or prefers root beer from a soda machine, while Todd thinks a soda machine root beer is a ghastly site at best.
