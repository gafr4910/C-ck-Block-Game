# Process Documentation

## Initial Brainstorming - 10.28.19
**Theme:**
* Start of game: “There is Todd and Linda, We hate Todd and Linda”, “Fuckin’ Todd….”
* Learns to love cock blocking people
* Motivation: sadistic personality, etc.
* Each level is the equivalent of one night, one level for now, with more difficult challenges as the player progresses

**Gameplay:**
* Inspiration: Untitled Goose Game
* Puzzle based - through discovery and exploration
* Possible multiple levels with several ways to finish: difficulty increases with each level? Each level (every night): cock-blocking a different couple?
* Ways to cock block: Getting too drunk, throwing up on people, staring at a person for too long, starting a fight, interacting with the people, bringing over “hotter” people, getting items from people, etc, blackmailing, creating awkwardness, messing up drinks, spilling drinks
* Enemy to the player: Bouncer, Time (bar close)
* Goals: break up the couple, don’t get caught by the bouncer, don’t run out of time (bar closing time), earn points by getting different outcomes, mini/side/extra missions, Easter eggs
* Break up as many people in the bar vs. having a puzzle based game to break up one couple.
* NPCs will have certain paths and reactions to events. Player can use some of these to their advantage to break up the couple.
NPCs have variety of specific personality traits that the player can take advantage of
* Repeat events every certain amount of time (ex: every 10 minutes)
* Special event at a specific time of night (ex: 1 AM)

**Art Style:**
* ex: Party Hard
* 2D fake, pixel art, 8-bit themed
* 3D top-down view so player can see a large amount of the screen
* Shadows/lighting for 3D aspect
* Different rooms: bar, dance floor, bathroom, pool table/arcade room, tables, etc.
